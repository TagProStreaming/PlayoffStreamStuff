# PlayoffStreamStuff
A folder for us to share access to streaming assets

#How to set this up for use (Windows only due to OBS restrictions)

On the right hand side of the browser, click "Clone in Desktop".  If you don't have GitHub
then this will take you to a download screen.  Install Github and GitShell and set up a GitHub
account.  

Once you open up GitHub and sign in, go back to the browser and click "Clone in Desktop" again.
This should open a dialog box.  Hit "Launch Application".  Download the repository and put it
in C:/.  So you should now have a folder C:/PlayoffStreamStuff with some things in it. It should
show up in your GitHub Client.

One you're there, there are directions in directions.txt for how to keep your local version of teh
repository up to date and how to add stuff to the repository for everyone to use.  If you're having
issues, you can find BBQ on Mumble or irc or PM me at /u/Splanky222 on Reddit for this project
specifically, but any of teh devs should be able to help you with GitHub as well.
